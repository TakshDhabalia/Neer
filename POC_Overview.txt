this doc documents the POC progress 
this is working on a server client type of system arch. where the server is the main reciever of data for display 
and the display of all the contents will happen on this 

1. to make the server we are going to make a NODEMCU a server by putting all the HTML in the script and uploading it and then make the server run on a power supply of 5V

2. to make the client we will make a HC-SR04 sensor module sense the data and store it in a temporary variable 
which will be published on the server side of the script where the end user can access the data in real time with minimal data

alternative - 

if both the MCUs are connected to the wifi (internert ) what we can do is use the MQTT protocol , where the broker and client is connected to a common connection . this can also be on the cloud where the broker can be HIVEMQ and other open cloud providers . 

this can also be used by an app which will be developed in Dart for android.

**Introduction**
This document outlines the detailed steps for creating a server-client system using NodeMCU and ESP8266 microcontrollers. The system is designed to display data from an HC-SR04 sensor module on the server (NodeMCU) and transmit it to Thingspeak via Wi-Fi, using ESP-NOW for communication between the client and server.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to establish a robust server-client architecture where:
- **NodeMCU acts as the server**, receiving and displaying data from an HC-SR04 sensor module which it recieves from the client.
- **ESP8266 acts as the client**, collecting sensor data and transmitting it to the server using ESP-NOW.
- Data from the server is sent via Wi-Fi to Thingspeak for storage and further displaying through a MIT App Inventor app.
